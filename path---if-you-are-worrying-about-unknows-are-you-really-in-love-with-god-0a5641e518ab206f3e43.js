He\nnever knew where he was going to sleep. He didn't know where his next meal was\ngoing to come from, but did he ever complain to God about not knowing what was\nnext? Did the early church ever spend too much time worrying about what was next\nfor them that they didn't take the chance to care for each other?</p>\n<p>\"Never be afraid to trust an unknown future to a known God.\" - Corrie Ten Boom</p>",frontmatter:{date:"December 05, 2017",path:"/if-you-are-worrying-about-unknows-are-you-really-in-love-with-god",title:"If you are worrying about unknowns, are you really in love with God?"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
