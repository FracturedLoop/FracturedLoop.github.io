As you can guess, the list was quite large, but that got me\nthinking... As far as programming, what would I tell myself? And that, my\nfriend, is what I have here, in no particular order.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Learn the right language and stick with it. If you want to do some extremely\nawesome mathy or sciency thing, or make games? I would suggest Python. I don't\nhave much experience with it, but I know it is incredibly beginner friendly,\nand there are a lot of recources out there to help. Do you want to do\nsomething that does something cool or just <em>looks</em> awesome? Go with web\ndevelopment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"But Josiah, web development isn't a language!\" Yeah, I know. But the stuff\nyou use for web development can be used in <em>so</em> many more places. Plus, what\nperson interested in technology doesn't need to make a website at some point\nor another? Yeah, there are some pretty decent WYSIWYG editors, but it's often\neasier to just do it with code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Learn to type.</em> This one might seem insignificant, but trust me, you'll wish\nyou had. I was one of those who had typing in school, but, as soon as it was\nover, did one of those \"brain dumps\" where you get rid of all that\n\"non-important information.\" Trust me. Learning to type is going to be a huge\nadvantage. Don't go the path I did and have to reteach yourself to do things\nright. It's a pain. A great resource for this one is\n<a href=\"https://www.typing.com/\">typing.com</a>. Go do yourself a favor and learn typing\nright.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Figure out the basics. This applies to just about anything, but I'm gonna talk\nparticularly about web development. Yeah, Javascript is cool and all, but\ndon't just dive into the \"cool\" stuff. It builds on all that boring stuff.\nHTML and CSS are great to learn, and they are relatively simple as well, so\nget to it! They may not seem that important now, but they'll save you a ton in\nthe future. Also (this applies to a bunch of things), Make sure you are\nunderstanding what you are learning before you move on. I have wasted many\nhours relearning stuff because I skimped on learning the basics.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't assume anything isn't worth learning. Approach everything like learning\nit is worthwhile. There are <em>plenty</em> of instances where I look back and wish I\nhad actually learned something instead of just \"learning\" enough to pass a\ntest. There are also those things that you <em>had</em> to study (parents made you?).\nDo yourself a favor and be willing to learn at every opportunity, even if you will probably never use it (<strong>Spoiler Alert</strong>: At some point, you'll probably need to use it.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maybe this should fall under the last one as well. When you are studying\nsomething, don't study it to use it, rather, study it to learn it. <em>All</em> the\ntime, I have a specific issue or forget the syntax for something (<em>cough</em>\nswitch statement <em>cough</em>), then, google, copy, paste, run, and done.\nSometimes, you actually <em>type</em> in the code (or text), but didn't take the time\nto figure out how a piece of code works or why it works the way it does. Let\nme tell you, take the 15 minutes to study what you need, and you'll save\nyourself <em>hours</em> in the future (and also you won't be kicking yourself for\nforgetting that same thing for the 10th time).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Learn to ask questions. The only stupid question is the one you didn't ask. I\nknow it can make you feel dumb, but its worth it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Programming is <em>hard</em>. It isn't always fun and exciting. There will come a\ntime where that one bug is really getting on your nerves or those objects just\ndon't make sense. There isn't much I can tell you here, except stick with it.\nThere will be those times when you are excited to build something sometime,\nbut if you don't struggle through the hard stuff now, you are never going to\nget to the fun stuff.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Find your passion. Make something you are excited about. If a project excites\nyou, you'll be able to work on it much longer without getting tired. Also, it\nwill be much easier to focus and avoid distractions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those are just a few things I have learned that will save you a bunch of time\nand effort. Quite a few of those principles are universal, so don't just try to\napply them to programming. There's quite a few of them that I still mess up on.\nBut stick with it, and it'll pay off.</p>",frontmatter:{date:"December 14, 2017",path:"/so-you-want-to-learn-programming",title:"So you want to learn programming (and other things), eh?"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
