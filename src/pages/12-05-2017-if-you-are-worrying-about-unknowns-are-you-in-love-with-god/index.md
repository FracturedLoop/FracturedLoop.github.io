A friend of mine recently made a blog post about unknowns. After reading it, it
made me wonder: If we are worried about unknowns, are we really relying on God,
or are we worrying about ourselves more than we should? I think of Paul. He
never knew where he was going to sleep. He didn't know where his next meal was
going to come from, but did he ever complain to God about not knowing what was
next? Did the early church ever spend too much time worrying about what was next
for them that they didn't take the chance to care for each other?
