I was wondering recently, if I could tell my younger self anything, what would
that be? As you can guess, the list was quite large, but that got me
thinking... As far as programming, what would I tell myself? And that, my
friend, is what I have here, in no particular order.

* Learn the right language and stick with it. If you want to do some extremely
  awesome mathy or sciency thing, or make games? I would suggest Python. I don't
  have much experience with it, but I know it is incredibly beginner friendly,
  and there are a lot of recources out there to help. Do you want to do
  something that does something cool or just _looks_ awesome? Go with web
  development.

* "But Josiah, web development isn't a language!" Yeah, I know. But the stuff
  you use for web development can be used in _so_ many more places. Plus, what
  person interested in technology doesn't need to make a website at some point
  or another? Yeah, there are some pretty decent WYSIWYG editors, but it's often
  easier to just do it with code.

* _Learn to type._ This one might seem insignificant, but trust me, you'll wish
  you had. I was one of those who had typing in school, but, as soon as it was
  over, did one of those "brain dumps" where you get rid of all that
  "non-important information." Trust me. Learning to type is going to be a huge
  advantage. Don't go the path I did and have to reteach yourself to do things
  right. It's a pain. A great resource for this one is
  [typing.com](https://www.typing.com/). Go do yourself a favor and learn typing
  right.

* Figure out the basics. This applies to just about anything, but I'm gonna talk
  particularly about web development. Yeah, Javascript is cool and all, but
  don't just dive into the "cool" stuff. It builds on all that boring stuff.
  HTML and CSS are great to learn, and they are relatively simple as well, so
  get to it! They may not seem that important now, but they'll save you a ton in
  the future. Also (this applies to a bunch of things), Make sure you are
  understanding what you are learning before you move on. I have wasted many
  hours relearning stuff because I skimped on learning the basics.

* Don't assume anything isn't worth learning. Approach everything like learning
  it is worthwhile. There are _plenty_ of instances where I look back and wish I
  had actually learned something instead of just "learning" enough to pass a
  test. There are also those things that you _had_ to study (parents made you?).
  Do yourself a favor and be willing to learn at every opportunity, even if you will probably never use it (**Spoiler Alert**: At some point, you'll probably need to use it.)

* Maybe this should fall under the last one as well. When you are studying
  something, don't study it to use it, rather, study it to learn it. _All_ the
  time, I have a specific issue or forget the syntax for something (_cough_
  switch statement _cough_), then, google, copy, paste, run, and done.
  Sometimes, you actually _type_ in the code (or text), but didn't take the time
  to figure out how a piece of code works or why it works the way it does. Let
  me tell you, take the 15 minutes to study what you need, and you'll save
  yourself _hours_ in the future (and also you won't be kicking yourself for
  forgetting that same thing for the 10th time).

* Learn to ask questions. The only stupid question is the one you didn't ask. I
  know it can make you feel dumb, but its worth it.

* Programming is _hard_. It isn't always fun and exciting. There will come a
  time where that one bug is really getting on your nerves or those objects just
  don't make sense. There isn't much I can tell you here, except stick with it.
  There will be those times when you are excited to build something sometime,
  but if you don't struggle through the hard stuff now, you are never going to
  get to the fun stuff.

* Find your passion. Make something you are excited about. If a project excites
  you, you'll be able to work on it much longer without getting tired. Also, it
  will be much easier to focus and avoid distractions.

Those are just a few things I have learned that will save you a bunch of time
and effort. Quite a few of those principles are universal, so don't just try to
apply them to programming. There's quite a few of them that I still mess up on.
But stick with it, and it'll pay off.
