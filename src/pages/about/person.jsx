      Well, as you’ve proabably already noticed, my name is Josiah. I’ve had the
      opportunity to work in some pretty cool places with great people. If you
      want to know more about that, feel free to check me out on{' '}

      As far as me as a person, though? I guess the largest influencer to me as
      a person is the fact that I’m a{' '}
      <a href="http://radical.net/the-gospel/">Christian</a>. I get that that
      doesn’t mean much to most people, but still, it’s a significant part of
      who I am, and why I do what I do.
    </p>

    <h3 id="what-i-do">So what do you do?</h3>
    <p>
      Well, that’s a good question. It honestly depends on who you ask. If you
      ask most people, they’ll say that I’m a computer guy, but I’ve done a
      bunch of other things as well. When serving with{' '}
      <a href="https://www.rmibridge.org/" target="_blank noopener noreferrer">
        Reciprocal Ministries International
      </a>{' '}
      in Les Cayes, Haiti, the label on my "office door" was "IT Services."
      Yeah, that’s a pretty broad definition. Basically, whenever anybody needed
      something done computer related, my phone was the one that rang. The
      day-to-day tasks could be anywhere from installing networking equipment
      atop a tower to quite literally "debugging" printers to doing technical
      trainings on a particular software or tool. IT wasn’t the only thing I did
      in Haiti though. Unofficially, I was the alternate maintenance man. So, I
      did anything from plumbing to concrete work to general repairs. I also had
      the opportunity to teach Science for some of the students in the school
      there. Man, there isn’t anything quite like teaching how the world works
      (and testing it, in some instances) and seeing it ’click’ for the
      students!
    </p>
    <p>
      While in Haiti (and before that... and continuing from that...) people
      often reach out to me to provide technical support, or even just basic
      training on how to use computers (or just about anything with a circuit
      board, for that matter.) I’ve had people contact me from as far as 3 hours
      away (not counting international ones) just to ask a quick question.

    <h3>Hobbies? Interests?</h3>
    <p>
      Well, obviously I like programming. I guess that comes from the fact that
      I like being creative and taking an idea from concept to actual product.
      That’s probably the reason I was so involved in{' '}
      <a href="https://biohazard4050.org/" target="_blank noopener noreferrer">
        FRC Team 4050.
      </a>{' '}
      It gave me an opportunity to push the boundaries of my knowledge, and work
      with people who had different skillsets and interests than I to accomplish
      some pretty incredible things.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to programming and making things, I also like to play with the
      guitar (notice that I said "play with" and not play). It’s always fun to
      make some noise :) Teaching is kinda another hobby I guess. As I noted
      near the bottom of the <a href="#what-i-do">"so what do you do"</a>{' '}
      section, I enjoy teaching people things as well. The topics vary a bunch,
      but obviously Science and tech are included.
